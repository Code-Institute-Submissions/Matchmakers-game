A Memory game that bring both colour and function

## UX

### Project purpose

Main purpose of this project is to provide easy game that entertains. It is designed to be easy enough for children to operate but the theme may also encourage adults to have a go.

#### Site user goals - children

- Easy game to operate
- Easy enough game to win
- Game that is fun
- Nice pictures to be matched
- Nice colours

Matchmaker game meets all the needs above because it provides intuitive navigation. They may not do this in smallest number of turns possible but they still can get sense of achievement by solving the puzzle. Game that provides this is always fun to play. This game is also colourful.

#### Site user goals - adults(parents and guardians)

- Game that will help my children develop.
- Easy to use for children and adults.
- Game that will challenge children but not discourage them at the same time.
- Game that my entice me to play myself.

Matchmaker game is training player's memory and exercising player's brain. Game is easy to use and challenging for users at any level. Some young children can get discouraged very easily and throw tantrums thus creating problem for parents. Luckily this game is easy enough for children to finish (match all cards) but the number of turns adds another layer to the challenge. This may also encourage some parents to play this game themselves.

#### User stories

- As a user and a parent I want to be presented with cards that present known to me characters
